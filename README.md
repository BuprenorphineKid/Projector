# Prj// Projector

simple tool to generate empty and named template projects or files.

if ur like me u hate retypin all that "package main" && "class %s" blah
bullshit. well here you go. written entirely in go, feel free to add 
support for your favorite languages. this tool is INCREDIBLY useful
despite its sinplicity.
